# 💳 Project 3 – Pricing Cards Component

A responsive pricing card layout built using **CSS Flexbox**.

---

## 🧭 Overview

Three pricing tiers – **Basic**, **Pro**, and **Enterprise** – displayed in a clean, flexible layout.  
Built as part of **Day 3: CSS Fundamentals Part 2**.

**Focus Areas:**
- Mastering Flexbox properties
- Responsive design
- CSS units & variables
- Component-style UI layouts

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- Flexible, responsive card layout using `display: flex`
- Dynamically wraps cards for small screens (`flex-wrap`)
- Featured “Pro” card with highlighted styling
- Smooth hover transitions
- Consistent sizing using `rem` and `%` units
- Reusable color and spacing system via CSS variables

## 🛠️ Core Concepts Practiced

| Concept | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| `display: flex` | Enables flexible container for all cards |
| `justify-content` | Controls horizontal spacing of cards |
| `align-items` | Aligns content vertically within cards |
| `flex-direction` | Adjusts card layout direction across breakpoints |
| `flex-wrap` | Allows cards to wrap responsively |
| CSS units | `rem`, `em`, `%`, and `vh` for responsive sizing |
| CSS variables | Reused colors and spacing for maintainability |

## 📱 Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop:** Cards appear side-by-side  
- **Tablet:** 2 cards per row  
- **Mobile:** Cards stack vertically  
Achieved using Flexbox + media queries.

## 🖌️ Design Notes

- Modern color palette (light gray + accent hues)
- Slight drop shadow & rounded corners for depth
- Lift-on-hover visual feedback for interactivity
- Accessible typography using relative units

## 🧠 Reflection

**What I learned:**
- How main and cross axes dynamically change with `flex-direction`
- The value of `flex-grow` for proportional sizing
- `rem` vs. `px` differences in scaling text responsively
- How CSS variables simplify theme adjustments

**Challenges faced:**
- Aligning buttons uniformly at the bottom
- Balancing spacing consistency with responsiveness
